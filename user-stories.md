## As a logged-out user

I can see a list/map of the most recent earthquakes, colour coded by pager response. I can click on the earthquake I want, and it will take me to that earthquake's page. There I can see the epicenter on a google map, date and time, magnitude, depth, tsunami warning if applicable, estimated fatalities and economic damage, user comments sections, (STRETCH) News Tracker or Twitter feed.

## As a logged-in user

All the above, plus - I can add a comment, edit, or delete my own. I can upvote or downvote comments. If a comment reaches a certain negative threshold, it will be hidden. (STRETCH) users can open and close hidden comments. I can go to a notification page and specify a country and magnitude that I am interested in receiving notifications for. Default is to receive an email (STRETCH) or I can chose to receive a text message. (STETCH) can see affected major industries for the region.

## I felt an earthquake

As an affected user (if I have internet), I want to go on the site and leave on a comment on my personal experience with the earthquake. Check the earthquake severity for fatality estimates and economic damage. (STRETCH) links to local disaster relief organizations and protocols or a donation link.
